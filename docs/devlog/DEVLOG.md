## 2026-09-30 00:58 IST — T-001 Kickoff: repo scaffold and doc skeletons (agent: orchestrator)
**What changed:** Created `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md` (with session log initialized), `docs/ADR.md`, `AI_USAGE.md`, `docs/acceptance.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, and directory skeletons for `backend/`, `frontend/`, `.github/workflows/`.
**Why:** Assignment requirement §1 & §7 to establish project structure, session logging, and architecture documentation from the very first commit.
**Decisions:** D-001 through D-006 recorded in `docs/decisions.md`.
**Verification:** `git status` verifies all scaffolded paths; tooling check verified available compilers/interpreters.
**AI mistakes caught:** none.
**Explain-it-in-review:** "We set up an agentic, ticket-driven repository layout with strict separation between pure CV/domain logic, adapters, entrypoints, and frontend SPA, backed by a clear ADR and session log."
**Next:** T-002 Confirm open decisions & T-010 Backend skeleton.

## 2026-09-30 23:27 IST — T-002 Confirm open decisions (agent: architect)
**What changed:** Confirmed the 6 default architecture and design choices. Verified `docs/decisions.md` and ADR are up to date.
**Why:** Required by Brief §4 and §5 to lock in model choices, hosting, and architecture before implementation.
**Decisions:** D-001 (YOLOX-S), D-002 (Fly.io+Neon), D-003 (Cookie Sessions), D-004 (API aliases), D-005 (OAuth PKCE), D-006 (Polling) all confirmed without changes.
**Verification:** Read `docs/decisions.md`.
**AI mistakes caught:** none.
**Explain-it-in-review:** "We reviewed the default tech stack options against the assignment constraints and formally committed to them, ensuring our upcoming development is fully aligned with the requirements."
**Next:** T-010 Backend skeleton, config, errors, /health, JSON logs
